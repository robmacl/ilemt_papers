We are currently working in responding to reviewer comments and revisions for the paper in metal/.   see metal/Reviewer\ comments.md  I'm trying to make the best paper I can given the data we've got and the space limitations (we are already into page charges and have moved content to a supplement.) 

This paper is in LaTex and was originally written on Overleaf. This paper is part of the ilemt_papers git repo rooted at '.'  Do not make changes to the paper until we discuss them.  Let's make a git commit for each substantial issue. Let's keep our response and notes in Obsidian markdown.

## Motivation

Well, we want to get it published. But the reason we did this research is that our ILEMT tracker has dual high/low carriers and we want to make some claims about the benefit of doing this. In addition, the literature is somewhat lacking on systematic empirical data relevant to the medical application, with physical explanations of behavior are not want they might be. Aside from the usefulness of LF modulation, we'd like to communicate that while interference is in general not predictable from simple models, these are the sort of things you can expect, such as rapid drop-off with distance. I want the paper to serve as a mini-tutorial introduction to EMT metal interference in general.
