1. Please replace the term “uncertainty “with “standard uncertainty” according to GUM -Guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement
==> we have replaced "uncertainty" with "standard uncertainty", "combined standard uncertainty", as appropriate. Minor rewording of expanded standard uncertainty to clarify.

2. The meaning of value listed in table II are not clear. Table label is “uncert is the measurement uncertainty including stage error: RMS error augmented according to eqn (10)” but RMS is smaller than uncert. I should be preferable to use in the Table the same symbols of (10)
==> we have changed column labels to match (10) and altered the caption to match.
