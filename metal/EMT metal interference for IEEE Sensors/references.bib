	abstract = {Optical and electromagnetic tracking systems represent the two main technologies integrated into commercially-available surgical navigators for computerassisted image-guided surgery so far. Optical Tracking Systems (OTSs) work within the optical spectrum to track the position and orientation, i.e., pose of target surgical instruments. OTSs are characterized by high accuracy and robustness to environmental conditions. The main limitation of OTSs is the need of a direct line-of-sight between the optical markers and the camera sensor, rigidly ﬁxed into the operating theatre. Electromagnetic Tracking Systems (EMTSs) use electromagnetic ﬁeld generator to detect the pose of electromagnetic sensors. EMTSs do not require such a direct line-of-sight, however the presence of metal or ferromagnetic sources in the operating workspace can signiﬁcantly affect the measurement accuracy. The aim of the proposed review is to provide a complete and detailed overview of optical and electromagnetic tracking systems, including working principles, source of error and validation protocols. Moreover, commercial and research-oriented solutions, as well as clinical applications, are described for both technologies. Finally, a critical comparative analysis of the state of the art which highlights the potentialities and the limitations of each tracking system for a medical use is provided.},

	abstract = {Background and objectives: The introduction of novel techniques in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) aiming to enhance outcomes and satisfaction of the procedure is constantly ongoing. In order to evidence a priority of one, we have conducted a randomized controlled trial with the aim of comparing patient-reported functional outcomes, radiographic outcomes and intraoperative measures between imageless (NAVIO and CORI), robotic-assisted (ra)- TKA (ra-TKA) and manual TKA (mTKA) for primary knee osteoarthritis (KOA). Materials and Methods: A total of 215 patients with the diagnosis of KOA of the knee were randomly assigned to one of the three groups: NAVIO (76 patients) or CORI (71 patients) robotic-assisted TKA, or manual technique (68 patients) TKA. The primary outcome (Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Study [KOOS]), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Range of motion (ROM), femoral component rotational alignment and the secondary outcomes (surgery time, blood loss, complications, and revision at 12 months after surgery) were compared between three groups. KOOS and VAS were collected at particular follow up visits from each patient individually and ROM in ﬂexion and extension was assessed during the physical examination. Femoral component rotational alignment was measured on the CT scan performed postoperatively utilizing the Berger’s method. Statistical signiﬁcance was set at p {\textless} 0.05. Results: Both the ra-TKA groups and mTKA group displayed signiﬁcant improvements in the majority of the functional outcome scores at 12 months. Despite having more prominent surgery time (NAVIO: mean +44.5 min in comparison to mTKA and CORI: mean +38.5 min in comparison to mTKA), both NAVIO and CORI tend to achieve highly accurate femoral component rotational alignment with mean radiographic scores in NAVIO vs. CORI vs. mTKA of 1.48◦ vs. 1.33◦ vs. 3.15◦ and lower blood loss (NAVIO: 1.74; CORI: 1.51; mTKA: 2.32. Furthermore, the investigation revealed the signiﬁcant difference in femoral component rotational alignment between mTKA—NAVIO and mTKA—CORI and signiﬁcantly different KOOS scores in NAVIO vs. CORI vs. mTKA of 87.05 vs. 85.59 vs. 81.76. Furthermore, the KOOS analysis showed between group signiﬁcant statistical differences, but did not reach minimal clinically signiﬁcant difference. There were no differences in postoperative ROM and VAS. There were no differences in complications between groups. Conclusions: To achieve a successful TKA, the precise tool and individualised objective is of great importance. The results suggest satisfactory results after both ra-TKA methods and mTKA. Ra-TKA and mTKA stand for a safe and reliable treatment method for OA. Patients reported excellent alleviation in functional outcomes and the radiological results revealed that the better precision does not necessarily lead to a better outcome. Therefore, ra-TKA does not imply strong enough advantages in comparison to the manual method, especially in terms of cost-efﬁciency and surgical time.},

This paper describes the instrument design for multidimensional position and orientation measurement based on the simultaneous position measurement of multiple modulated sources using frequency-domain-multiplexed (FDM) PSDs. The important advantages of this optical conﬁguration in comparison with laser/mirror combinations are that it has a large angular measurement range and allows the use of a probe that is small in comparison with the measurement volume. We review PSD characteristics and quantitative resolution limits, consider the lock-in ampliﬁer measurement system as a communication link, discuss the application of FDM to PSDs, and make comparisons with time-domain techniques. We consider the phase-sensitive detector as a multirate DSP problem, explore parallels with Fourier spectral estimation and ﬁlter banks, discuss how to choose the modulation frequencies and sample rates that maximize channel isolation under design constraints, and describe efﬁcient digital implementation. We also discuss hardware design considerations, sensor calibration, probe construction and calibration, and 3-D measurement by triangulation using two sensors. As an example, we characterize the resolution, speed, and accuracy of an instrument that measures the position and orientation of a 10 mm × 5 mm probe in 5 degrees of freedom (DOF) over a 30-mm cube with 4-μm peak-to-peak resolution at 1-kHz sampling.},

	abstract = {We describe the design and performance of a hand-held actively stabilized tool to increase accuracy in micro-surgery or other precision manipulation. It removes involuntary motion such as tremor by actuating the tip to counteract the effect of the undesired handle motion. The key components are a three-degree-of-freedom piezoelectric manipulator that has 400 μm range of motion, 1 N force capability, and bandwidth over 100 Hz, and an optical position measurement subsystem that acquires the tool pose with 4 μm resolution at 2000 samples/s. A control system using these components attenuates hand motion by at least 15 dB (a fivefold reduction). By considering the effect of the frequency response of Micron on the human visual feedback loop, we have developed a filter that reduces unintentional motion, yet preserves intuitive eye-hand coordination. We evaluated the effectiveness of Micron by measuring the accuracy of the human/ machine system in three simple manipulation tasks. Handheld testing by three eye surgeons and three non-surgeons showed a reduction in position error of between 32\% and 52\%, depending on the error metric.},

Several studies have shown that motion analysis is a valuable assessment tool of basic surgical skills in laparoscopy.

This article describes the state of the art in research on tracking systems for laparoscopy. It gives an overview on existing systems, on how these systems work, their advantages, and their shortcomings. Although various approaches have been used, none of the tracking systems to date comes out as clearly superior. A great number of systems can be used in training environment only, most systems do not allow the use of real laparoscopic instruments, and only a small number of systems provide force feedback.},

New ﬁelds of image-guided surgery applications are opened by attaching small electromagnetic position sensors to 3D ultrasound probes. However, nothing is known about the distortions caused by 3D ultrasound probes regarding electromagnetic sensors. Several trials were performed to investigate error-proneness of state-of-the-art electromagnetic tracking systems when used in combination with 3D ultrasound probes. It was found that 3D ultrasound probes do distort electromagnetic sensors more than 2D probes do. When attaching electromagnetic sensors to 3D probes, maximum errors of 5 mm up to 119 mm occur. The distortion strongly depends on the electromagnetic technology as well on the probe technology used. Thus, for 3D ultrasound-guided applications using electromagnetic tracking technology, the interference of ultrasound probes and electromagnetic sensors have to be checked carefully.

	abstract = {The positional and rotational accuracy of a direct-current magnetic tracking device commonly used in biomechanical investigations was evaluated. The effect of different metals was also studied to determine the possibility of interference induced by experimental test fixtures or orthopaedic implants within the working field. Positional and rotational data were evaluated for accuracy and resolution by comparing the device output to known motions as derived from a calibrated grid board or materials testing machine. The effectof different metals was evaluated by placing cylindrical metal samples at set locations throughout the working field and comparing the device readings before and after introducing each metal sample. Positional testing revealed an optimal operational range with the transmitter and receiver separation between 22.5 and 64.0 cm. Within this range the mean positional error was found to be 1.8\% of the step size, and resolution was determined to be 0.25 mm. The mean rotational error over a l-20” range was found to be 1.6\% of the rotational increment, with a rotational resolution of 0.1”. Of the metal alloys tested only mild steel produced significant interference, which was maximum when the sample was placed adjacent to the receiver. At this location the mild steel induced a positional difference of 5.26 cm and an angular difference of 9.75”. The device was found to be insensitive to commonly used orthopaedic alloys. In this study, the electromagnetic tracking device was found to have positional and rotational errors of less than 2\%, when utilized within its optimal operating range. This accuracy combined with its insensitivity to orthopaedic alloys should make it suitable for a variety of musculoskeletal research investigations. Copyright 0 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

	abstract = {Purpose Electromagnetic tracking (EMT) accuracy is affected by the presence of surrounding metallic materials. In this work, we propose measuring the magnetic ﬁeld’s variation due to distortion at a witness position to localise the instrument causing distortion based on a pre-trained model and without additional sensors attached to it.
Methods Two experiments were performed to demonstrate possible applications of the technique proposed. In the ﬁrst case, the distortion introduced by an ultrasound (US) probe was characterised and subsequently used to track the probe position on a line. In the second application, the measurement was used to estimate the distance of an interventional ﬂuoroscopy C-arm machine and apply the correct compensation model.
Results Tracking of the US probe using the proposed method was demonstrated with millimetric accuracy. The distortion created by the C-arm caused errors in the order of centimetres, which were reduced to 1.52 mm RMS after compensation.
Conclusions The distortion proﬁle associated with medical equipment was pre-characterised and used in applications such as object tracking and error compensation map selection. In the current study, the movement was limited to one degree of freedom (1 DOF) and simple analytical functions were used to model the magnetic distortion. Future work will explore advanced AI models to extend the method to 6 DOF tracking using multiple witness sensors.},

	abstract = {Many computer-assisted surgery applications use electromagnetic tracking devices and several sources of interference may reduce the accuracy of this type of system in clinical situations. This study aims to quantify interference sources in an operating room (OR) and determine if their impact on the tracking system is excessive for applications requiring millimetric accuracy. Electromagnetic noise levels were measured in a controlled environment and compared with measurements in an OR. Errors generated by this noise remained below the 0.15 mm RMS level. OR equipment was also brought in proximity to the electromagnetic receivers and the errors generated by the ensuing interference were measured. Ferromagnetic and electrical devices can produce large interference (translation errors up to 8.4 mm RMS and rotation up to 1661). However, these devices can be identiﬁed and placed at sufﬁcient distances to decrease the magnitude of their interference. In conclusion, in the absence of signiﬁcant ferromagnetic or electromagnetic distortion caused by equipment often present in an OR, this electromagnetic tracking system provides valid relative measurements with millimetric accuracy to computer-assisted surgical applications. This distortion can be reduced by maximizing the distances to the interfering OR equipment and integrating noise-reducing algorithms in associated software. r 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

	abstract = {At radio frequencies, the penetration of currents and magnetic fields into the surface of conductors is governed by the skin effect. Many formulas are simplified if expressed in terms of the "depth of penetration," which has merely the dimension of length but involves the frequency and the conductivity and permeability of the conductive material. Another useful parameter is the "surface resistivity" determined by the skin effect, which has simply the dimension of resistance. These parameters are given for representative metals by a convenient chart covering a wide range offrequency. The 'incrementalinductance rule" is givenfor determining not only the effective resistance of a circuit but also the added resistance caused by conductors in the neighborhood of the circuit. Simpleformulas are given for the resistance of wires, transmtssion lines, and coils; for the shielding effect of sheet metal;for the resistance caused by a plane or cylindrical shield near a coil; andfor the properties of a transformer with a laminated iron core.},

A magnetic relaxation is observed at approximately 5 kHz. The relaxation can be described in terms of a parametric (Cole-Cole) model. Factors which inﬂuence the frequency, amplitude and breadth of the relaxation, such as applied current amplitude, sample geometry and disorder (e.g. percent carbon content and surface condition), are considered.},

The procedure is based on calculating total magnetic moment by integrating the magnetic induction obtained from a full three dimensional solution of the Maxwell equations using adaptive mesh. The results are relevant for superconductors (and conductors in AC fields) when the London penetration depth (or the skin depth) is much smaller than the sample size. Simple but reasonably accurate approximate formulas are given for practical shapes including rectangular cuboids, finite cylinders in axial and transverse field as well as infinite rectangular and elliptical cross-section strips.},
