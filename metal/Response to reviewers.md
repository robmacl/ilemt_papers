# Response to Reviewer Comments

## Reviewer 1

We thank Reviewer 1 for the constructive feedback and positive assessment of our work. We have addressed all comments as detailed below.

---

### R1.1: Add paper structure at end of introduction ✓

**Comment:** Add a structure of the paper at the end of introduction, to help the reader, since the paper is quite long.

**Response:** We have added a paper organization paragraph at the end of the Introduction section (after the paragraph describing the study goals). The new text reads:

> "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II reviews related work, and Section III provides background on EMT operating principles. Section IV presents metal interference theory. Section V describes our experimental methodology. Section VI presents results and discusses the effects of metal type, shape, position, orientation, and modulation frequency. Section VII summarizes key findings, and Section VIII concludes with practical recommendations."

**Location in revised manuscript:** Introduction, end of section (line 66)

### R1.2: Improve abstract ✓

**Comment:** Abstract should be improved, giving a brief background of EMTs and the metallic interference. It should also be more concise and provide less numerical data, since concepts like "theoretical exponent" and others cannot be understood without reading the paper.

**Response:** We have revised the abstract to address all these concerns:
- Added opening sentence explaining that EMTs are position sensors used for surgical navigation and robotic guidance
- Reorganized into two paragraphs for better readability
- Removed technical terms requiring paper context (e.g., "theoretical exponent")
- Emphasized key finding that 300 Hz and pulsed DC modulations produce nearly identical results, validating ILEMT's dual-frequency approach
- Focused on most significant and unexpected results (260× variation, sheet behavior)
- Made more concise (~210 words vs ~240 words in original)

**Location in revised manuscript:** Abstract (lines 44-49)

---

### R1.3: Add units to all numerical values ✓

**Comment:** Please, make sure that all numerical values are provided with unit of measurement, both in main text and in tables/figures (if dimensionless, specify it).

**Response:** We have conducted a thorough audit of all numerical values throughout the paper. Key changes include:
- Table I: Changed μᵣ column header from "(dimensionless)" to "(ratio)" for clarity and improved column width
- Added or verified units in all figures and tables
- Specified units where they were missing in the text

**Location in revised manuscript:** Throughout paper, particularly Table I (line 242)

### R1.4: Add more EMT operating principles background

**Comment:** Please, add more background about EMT operating principles. You provide a lot of background on distortions, but the paper lacks introduction on how EMT works. An expert in the field will understand, but a novice will not. This will also help to better match the IEEE Sensor Journal aim, since an EMT is indeed a position SENSOR: please, make it clear.

**Response:** [TO BE COMPLETED]

**Location in revised manuscript:** [TBD - Section III]

---

### R1.5: Improve table captions

**Comment:** Tables' captions should be more detailed and better explain tables' content (e.g., table IV).

**Response:** [TO BE COMPLETED]

**Location in revised manuscript:** [TBD]

---

### R1.6: Fix Fig. 5 labels and units

**Comment:** Fig. 5: specify that (a) is trakSTAR, (b) is ILEMT. Moreover, add unit of measurement for (20, 0)

**Response:** [TO BE COMPLETED]

**Location in revised manuscript:** [TBD - Figure 5 caption]

---

### R1.7: Clarify Section V.B setup

**Comment:** Section V.B: The setup is not clear. Which sensor are you using? How do you acquire measurements? Is the sensor moved manually? How do you guarantee position accuracy?

**Response:** [TO BE COMPLETED]

**Location in revised manuscript:** [TBD - Section V.B]

---

### R1.8: Improve conclusions organization ✓

**Comment:** Conclusions can be improved (e.g. paragraph "The ILEMT approach of simultaneous […]" should be moved before paragraph "Future work could explore […]")

**Response:** We have reordered the Conclusion section as suggested. The paragraph discussing the ILEMT approach to simultaneous multi-frequency measurement now appears before the future work paragraph, providing better logical flow from current findings to future directions.

**Location in revised manuscript:** Conclusion section (lines 652-654)

---

### R1.9: Check supplementary material citation format

**Comment:** I'm not sure whether Supplementary material should be cited in references or not. Please, check it.

**Response:** [TO BE COMPLETED]

**Location in revised manuscript:** [TBD]

---

### R1.10: Add more up-to-date references

**Comment:** Add more up-to-date references, particularly regarding related work (section II).

**Response:** [TO BE COMPLETED]

**Location in revised manuscript:** [TBD - Section II]

## Reviewer 2

We thank Reviewer 2 for their detailed comments. However, we respectfully note that many of the requested additions represent significant scope expansions that would each constitute separate research papers. Our paper focuses on systematic fundamental characterization of metallic interference under controlled conditions, which is a necessary foundation for the broader applications suggested by the reviewer.
